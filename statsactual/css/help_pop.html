    <td><h1>Understanding this Report</h1>

<p>Statistics are <a href="http://www.projectcounter.org/cop/books/cop_books_ref.pdf">Counter Compliant</a>. Statistics are updated nightly,
and several different types of statistics are reported in an effort to provide maximum flexibility and data to meet a variety of customer needs.</p>

<p><b>Documents Retrieved</b> represents the number of individual web pages that have been viewed.</p>

<p><a name="Anchor-About-sessions"><b>Sessions</b></a> is an estimated calculation of the number of individual users accessing our site. Sessions are
determined based on the Counter Compliance guidelines: a session statistic is logged the first time that a user accesses our site. Thereafter a new
session is logged either when a logout occurs, the browser window is closed, or when the browser has been inactive for a period of five minutes or more.</p>

<h2>Range Requested and Active Date Range</h2>

<p>Statistics are reported beginning with the earliest date of actual usage in the date range requested. A discrepancy between the dates in the
range requested and the range reported may reflect a lack of usage at the start of the range requested.</p>

<p>Statistics are reflective of authentication data provided by the customer at the lowest level of granularity available.</p>

<h2></a>Selecting a Report</h2>

<p>There are four types of statistics reports provided. Each of these reports is displayed in the same manner, but the data
retrieved varies, depending on the type of report you wish to view. Please note that some reports may not apply to your account, and only
those reports that are applicable will be displayed.</p>

<h4>Summary Report with Individual Site Usage</h4>

<p>This report is a Grand Summary that includes the statistical information for all institutions represented under one account.</p>

<h4>Summary Report without Individual Site Usage</h4>

<p>This report is a Summary that includes only the statistical information for the owner or owner institution of the account.</p>

<h4>Individual Site Report</h4>

<p>This report is a breakdown by site that includes the statistical information for selected sites under a particular account.
Please note that this breakdown is by site only for the date range selected. For monthly reports by site, you must specify
the month in the date range fields, then select the Individual Site Report.</p>

<h4>User Groups</h4>

<p>This report includes the statistical information for the user groups that you have selected (as designated by your site administrator).
Please note that this breakdown is by group only for the date range selected. For monthly reports by site, you must specify the month in
the date range fields, then select the Individual Site Report.</p>
